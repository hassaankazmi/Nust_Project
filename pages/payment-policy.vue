                        PayPal is a safer, easier way to send and receive money online. When
                        you select PayPal as the payment method, you will be linked to the
                        PayPal site where you can make payment.
                      </p>

                        PayPal can be used to purchase items by Credit Card (Visa,
                        MasterCard, Discover, and American Express), Debit Card, or E-check
                        (i.e. using your regular Bank Account).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        1) After viewing your items on your shopping cart page, you can
                        click and check out with PayPal. Then you will leave our site and
                        enter PayPal’s website.
                        <br />2) You can sign in to your PayPal account, or you can create a
                        new one if you haven’t got one. <br />3) You can use the PayPal as
                        you want according to the on-screen instructions.

                      <p>
                        Usually, PayPal e-check will take 3-5 business days to be confirmed
                        by PayPal.

                      <p>
                        The reasons why we suggest you use PayPal:
                        <br />Payment is traceable. By using your PayPal account, you can
                        trace the status of your payment. <br />When you make payment for
                        your order, you don’t need to use your credit card online (you can
                        transfer directly from your bank account). When you use your credit
                        card through PayPal, nobody will see your credit card number, which
                        will minimize the risk of unauthorized use
